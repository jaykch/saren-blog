Saren token is here
-----------
As promised, Saren token (SAR) is going live today at 00:00 GMT. After careful consideration, I have increased the total
supply from 100 Million to 1 Billion. I wanted to cap the amount of tokens initially so there is no minting function to
be able to mint later. Recently a few big projects have been hacked because of the minting functionality of the token,
SAR has no minting functionality and only 1 Billion tokens will ever exist.

However, we can still burn the tokens manually (if there is a need for it in future) by sending them to
**[0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b?a)**
address which is often used for burning Erc20 tokens.

For any further details on SAR please visit - **[Saren.io](https://saren.io/token)**

Contract address and deployment
----------

Token was deployed earlier today on Kovan testnet and Ethereum mainnet. Both deployments comply with the universal ERC20
token standard and can be traded and transferred accordingly. If you are unsure or have any doubts, please try the
testnet tokens before buying on mainnet.

**Ethereum ERC20
address:** [0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b?a)

**Kovan testnet
address:** [0x26e8cc3eef4df3bd68c28dc748c1ca85f1930932](https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0x26e8cc3eef4df3bd68c28dc748c1ca85f1930932?a)

Use cases
----------

At the moment I have the following use cases that will be implemented in the near future:

* **Governance protocol:** Any governance decisions like new token rewards, changes to liquidity reserves etc. will be
  done through a protocol which will use Saren tokens as primary voting power.
* **Subscription protocol:** Holders of Saren will get reduced fees on the upcoming subscription protocol in Q3.
* **Advertisements:** Any advertisements on Saren apps will have to paid for in Saren tokens which will be redistributed
  amongst the app users to build a self-sustained ecosystem.
* **Cerberus:** Once the decentralisation of Cerberus is complete, companies will have to hold Saren tokens to be able
  to list new coins on **[Cerberus](https://cerberus.saren.io)**.
* **Shill my coins app:** Our next app that will be released in Q2 2021 will be a reddit like forum where Saren holders
  will be able to make a post about any coin listed on **[Cerberus](https://cerberus.saren.io)**.

As the project develops and new apps are added to Saren, more use cases will be created which will use SAR as the
primary currency.

Where to buy?
-------------

Decentralisation is the core of Saren and in line with this principle, SAR tokens will be listed directly on uniswap.
This is to make sure no whales accumulate it in a private or public sale. I believe that everyone should have an equal
chance to buy the token, and a public uniswap listing available to all is the best way to go about it.

You will need to import the token in uniswap using the contract address: **0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b**.
It may take up to a minute for it to load on uniswap, just paste it in the search bar and wait until SAR appears right
below with an import button next to it.

Alternatively you can
click **[here](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b)** to go directly
to ETH-SAR pair on Uniswap.
