Server upgrades
-----------
Due to increased traffic and many new coins being imported from coignecko daily, I have doubled the bots collecting data
and migrated the main **[Cerberus](http://cerberus.saren.io/)** DAPP server. Loading times should be improved and price
feeds should be updated at an average of 5 minutes per coin/token. Database server has also been upgraded for more
storage and improved data transfer speeds.

Additionally, we have started working on paging and other performance upgrades for much faster load times.

New Partner: Moontools
-----------
We are excited to announce our newest partner **[Moontools](https://www.moontools.io/)**. Moontools offers real-time
data for tokens and allows you to monitor and strategize your trades. Their app is a customizable dashboard that allows
you to track portfolio, price alerts, market explorer, and many more features coming soon. Moreover, they have advanced
features like notifications for new token listings, access to reviews on tokens, partnership perks, etc.

**Coming Next:** More partnerships and AMA

AMA Nerd Finance
-------------------
We are currently in talks of partnering up with **[Nerd Finance](http://nerd.finance/)**. We have an AMA set up with
them on **Tuesday, May 4th 2021**. We will be tweeting out the exact time and twitch link to watch the AMA later today.

About us page
-------------
Due to the increased team size and partners as well as other team announcements coming soon, I have decided to add an
about us page on **[Saren](http://saren.io/)**. Keep an eye out for it this week for our existing and upcoming partners.

Timelock Contract
-------------------
With the registration of our company this week, I have completed and added a timelock contract to the list of open
source saren contracts available on our **[github repository](https://github.com/saren-io/saren-contracts)**. The
timelock contract can be
viewed **[here](https://github.com/saren-io/saren-contracts/blob/main/contracts/token/utils/timelock.sol)**. It will be
used to lock up most of the funds with some tokens left over for current and future investors.

Once the investment paperwork is finalised, their tokens will be added to separate timelock contracts.
