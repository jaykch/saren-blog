New Features
-----------
We have added a past votes section where users can view all votes that have passed or failed. These are sorted by time,
so the most recent one can be seen first and so on.

Users can now view how many **$SAR** they hold from their phone. If you have a metamask enabled browser, you will be
able to connect to **[Cerberus](https://cerberus.saren.io)** and vote directly from your phone.

**Coming This Week:** We are working on finishing up commenting on votes this week. We have implemented the commenting
api and are currently working on a machine learning moderation api. The api will use
**[Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** to stop any sensitive comments.

Users can now add the wallet key in url to view any wallet using this
format `https://cerberus.saren.io/wallet/${publicKey}`
For example, going
here- **[https://cerberus.saren.io/wallet/0x2c03d6aba12b3f33655184488492f164aeff6098](https://cerberus.saren.io/wallet/0x2c03d6aba12b3f33655184488492f164aeff6098)**
would show you all coins in that wallet.

Investor Updates
--------------
Investor talks have gone well and new investors will soon join the project as advisors. They have been provided a minor
OTC discount and funds will be locked for a minimum of 6 months with a release schedule of 10% every month after the
lockup period has ended.

**Coming Next:** A followup announcement will be made next week with an introduction to investors and more details.

Partnerships
--------------
We are happy to announce that we have partnered with **[Fera strategies](https://www.ferastrategies.com/)**. FERA
selects low-cap projects colloquially known as hidden gems, providing comprehensive reviews and ratings. Their service
covers technical and fundamental analysis, fund management and short-term price predictions that helps their users make
informed investments.

Saren can now be viewed on **[Fera Platform](https://feraplatform.com/)** as its latest addition.

Additionally, we have partnered with **[Penguin Party](https://penguinparty.eth.link/)**. Penguin Party is a
MetaGovernance DAO that participates as a governance delegate on Uniswap and Compound and operates PenguinSwap - an
open-source, community-run interface for Uniswap.

Trade and liquidity buttons now take you directly to Penguin Party tools. Penguin party has agreed to give **$SAR**
preferential routing on their swap and more collaborations with penguin party will be announced in the future.

**Coming Next:** Partners page on Saren.io and how each partnership will work for more transparency.

Team
--------------
We now have a team of 4 members. Each of their profile can be viewed on
our **[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saren-io/)**

I have hired a community manager and 2 developers. Additionally, I am working on hiring a dedicated developer for
cerberus and another for shill my coins. After onboarding these developers I will start working solely on the
subscription protocol and saren as a company.

**Coming Next:** Company registration for centralised exchanges, separate entity for intellectual property as well as
patent registration and trust to protect company assets.

Transparency
----------------
Due to new users of **$SAR** being confused about the wallets on Etherscan, I have asked Etherscan to clearly tagged
these wallets. The development, marketing and team wallets are now clearly marked
on **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b#balances)** for more
transparency.

**Coming Next:** Updated market cap and circulating supply on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko.
