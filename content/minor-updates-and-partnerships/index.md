New Features
-----------
We have added a past votes section where users can view all votes that have passed or failed. These are sorted by time,
so the most recent one can be seen first and so on.

Users can now view how many $SAR they hold from their phone. If you have a metamask enabled browser, you will be able to
connect to **[Cerberus](https://cerberus.saren.io)** and vote directly from your phone.

**Coming This Week:** We are working on finishing up commenting on votes this week. We have implemented the commenting
api and are currently working on a machine learning moderation api. The api will use
**[Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** to stop any sensitive comments.

Investor Updates
--------------
Investor talks have gone well and new investors will soon join the project as advisors. They have been provided a minor
OTC discount and funds will be locked for a minimum of 6 months with a release schedule of 10% every month after the
lockup period has ended.

A followup announcement will be made next week with an introduction to investors and investment strategy.

Partnerships
--------------
We are happy to announce that we have partnered with **[Fera strategies](https://www.ferastrategies.com/)**. FERA
selects low-cap projects colloquially known as hidden gems, providing comprehensive reviews and ratings. Our service
covers technical and fundamental analysis, fund management and short-term price predictions that will help you make
informed investments.

Saren can now be viewed on **[Fera Platform](https://feraplatform.com/)** as its latest addition.

Additionally, we have partnered with **[Penguin Party](https://penguinparty.eth.link/)**. Trade button now takes you
directly to Penguinswap. Penguin party has agreed to give $SAR preferential routing on their swap.

Team
--------------
We now have a team of 4 members. Each of their profile can be viewed on
our **[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saren-io/)**

I have hired a community manager and 2 developers. Additionally, I am working on hiring a dedicated developer for
cerberus and another for shill my coins. After onboarding these developers I will start working solely on the
subscription protocol and saren as a company.

**Coming Next:** Company registration for centralised exchanges, separate entity for intellectual property as well as
patent registration and trust to protect company assets.
