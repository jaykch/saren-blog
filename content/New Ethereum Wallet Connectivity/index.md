The phrase, *“form over function”* is a perfect description of a problem that was common in technology interfaces prior to the introduction of UX design. Technology developers were primarily concerned with how their device, app, and website interfaces looked. UI, or user interface designers had a field day cooking up slick, futuristic interface displays, with high-tech looking buttons and visually-arresting animations. It was all about eye candy, and it was Halloween and Easter every day of the year.

Unfortunately, this focus on form made function an afterthought. It simply wasn’t that important how the interface worked as long as it was flashy and exciting.

And this ushered in the dark ages of interface design, a period filled with cool-looking interfaces that were clunky and confusing, interfaces that often worked against the user instead of being helpful. Imagine an eye candy store where all the confections were thrown randomly onto shelves, without signs letting you know where to find what you were looking for. You’d have a store filled with visually-delicious items that no one wanted to shop at because they couldn’t locate anything.


Enter UX Design

In response to this candy-coated explosion of visual confusion, UX design became increasingly important. UX, or user experience design became necessary to reign in the excesses of UI designers fat on their steady diet of optical confections.

UX design isn’t at all concerned with how an interface looks. Most UX design is, in fact, done with wireframe buttons and simple interface elements devoid of discernible aesthetics. UX designers instead focus entirely on how an interface works. They’re concerned with how people experience the interface.

Is the interface intuitive? Is it clear to users what buttons do and where a click is likely to take them? Does the structure seem clear or does the interface element layout feel arbitrary? Does the interface help users feel they’re able to accomplish the tasks they came to the app or device to accomplish or is the interface getting in the way?

These are some of the questions UX designers try to answer. They work to impose useful structure on the visual designs of the UI designers. The two disciplines complement each other, which is why the whole field is now referred to as UI/UX design.

UI/UX Design is Born
-----------

By working together, UI designers are free to make stuff look cool, knowing that the UX designers will organize their visual designs in a way that creates a positive user experience. And the UX designers can spend their time building powerful user experiences that flow intuitively, knowing that the UI designers will flesh out these formless interface hierarchies with dynamic visuals that enhance the user’s experience, creating a beautiful interface that cleanly facilitates users doing whatever it is that they came to do.

To sum up, UI/UX design is the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup of app, web, and device interface creation.

> UI Designer: “Hey, you got your user experience in my user interface!”

>UX Designer: “You got your user interface on my user experience!”

> UI/UX Designers: “Delicious!”

> UI/UX design. Two great tastes that taste great together.”

The addition of UX design has ushered in a golden age of technology interface design, where form and function are equally important, and complement each other to create interfaces of unparalleled style and utility. The eye candy store is now well-organized and clearly labeled, and we can all get blissed out on the experience.
