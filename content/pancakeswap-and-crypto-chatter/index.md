Pancakeswap Listings
-----------
We are happy to announce that pancakeswap listings are now live. It took a while as the subgraph for pancakeswap is out
of sync and there is no reliable way to get historic data for binance chain coins. After some thought, I decided to
start storing our own data just like coinmarketcap and coingecko. I had this planned for a while and finally decided to
go through with it.

As we move forward with cerberus, we will start generating our own data and stop external API dependencies. Due to
adding a lot of new features in the first month we have loaded up on a lot of technical debt. The next milestone will be
a major performance upgrade. Think of it as a Cerberus v2 with night-mode, paging, improved UI etc. Obviously, this is a
lot of work and we want to get everything right so the next development update will be rolled out in stages over a
prolonged period of time.

Investments
-----------
We have secured $500,000 in investment from [Stacker.VC](https://stacker.vc/). We are currently finalising more
investment deals, and will make a detailed separate blog on investments once everything is finalised.

I have already hired our first full-time developer and will be spending the next two months on a detailed roadmap and
marketing plan for Saren in addition to hiring more developers and marketing staff.

Crypto Chatter
----------------
I will be going live on **[Crypto chatter with John Dog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMikCvihU2L3HERP0IWPZhA)**
later next week on **11:00 CET, Thursday, 20th of May**. I liked the format of the show and thought it would help answer
a lot of questions from the community and also introduce us to other communities.
