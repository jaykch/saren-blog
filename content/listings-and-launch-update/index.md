Listing on tracking apps
-----------

I am happy to report that **[$SAR](https://cerberus.saren.io/coins/0xbd4a858139b155219e2c8d10135003fdef720b6b)** has
been listed on **[Delta](https://delta.app/en)** and  **[Blockfolio](https://blockfolio.com/)**. Additionally, you can
view the current price and tweets on our **[Cerberus](https://cerberus.saren.io/)** app by searching for sar in the
search bar.

Investors and liquidity update
--------------
There has been a lot of investor interest but all required that the token be sold to them between $0.005 - $0.01. I have
declined all offers as I do not believe this is the right direction to move forward with the project. I am moving away
from applying for bulk investment and would only be accepting small strategic investments by big organisations.

Hence, I am announcing that all tokens will be locked until further notice. The remaining 220M tokens in the liquidity
reserves will be used to add liquidity in future through exchange listings and so forth.

**Addressing the current liquidity:** The current uniswap liquidity is at 500,000+ which is more than most tokens
available in the top 500. I feel that the current liquidity is enough for active trading by our users, and until there
is an overwhelming need to add more liquidity, I have decided to focus all resources on development and implementing
features.

Launch update
--------------
We have had an amazing launch for Cerberus, and I am happy to announce that we reached 1000+ unique users this week.

**Note:** Metric does not take into account any users that have a brave browser or privacy disabled.

As the traffic increases, we will have maintenance updates to upgrade Saren servers and improve performance. Cache has
also been enabled to improve loading speeds as we continue to move out of the beta phase.

So far 221 coins have been added by our users in a permissionless way through our decentralised coingecko import.

**Coming Next:** Uniswap decentralised listings.

**P.S.:** I have never worked for the australian government just to be clear.
